# Welcome

[**OpenAlex** ](https://openalex.org)is a free and open catalog of the global research system. It's named after the [ancient Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library\_of\_Alexandria) and made by the nonprofit [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/).

These are the help pages for OpenAlex, containing information about the [data](how-it-works/entities-overview.md), the [website](https://openalex.org) where you can start exploring, and the background concepts. To learn about the API, the data snapshot, and other fun stuff, head over to our [technical documentation.](https://docs.openalex.org)
