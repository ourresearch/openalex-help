Work types classify the form of a scholarly document. Each work has exactly one type.

## Values

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| `article` | Original, citable research usually in a journal, including full research papers, brief communications, technical notes, and full-paper case reports. |
| `book` | A scholarly book published as a complete, standalone volume, such as a monograph or authored or edited volume. |
| `book-chapter` | A single chapter or section within a book, such as a contributed chapter in an edited volume, sometimes presenting original research. |
| `book-review` | An evaluation of one book and its significance, such as a book review or a review essay focused on a single book, usually published in a journal's book-review section. |
| `conference-abstract` | A standalone abstract for a conference or symposium presentation, published without the accompanying full paper, such as a meeting abstract, poster abstract, or abstract-only proceedings record. |
| `conference-paper` | A complete paper delivered at a conference, symposium, or meeting and usually appearing in the published proceedings, including proceedings papers and review talks given at a conference. |
| `data-paper` | A peer-reviewed paper written mainly to describe a dataset, such as a data descriptor or data article, rather than to analyze it. |
| `dataset` | The deposited data artifact itself, such as a dataset, data collection, or database record, typically with its own DOI, not a paper about the data. |
| `dissertation` | A document submitted in completion of an academic degree or professional qualification, such as a PhD or master's thesis or dissertation. |
| `editorial` | A piece expressing the views of an individual, group, or organization on a broad topic rather than on one specific work, such as an editorial, commentary, interview, or research highlight. |
| `erratum` | A journal-issued fix for mistakes in a published article, such as an erratum, corrigendum, or publisher correction, referencing the article it corrects. |
| `letter` | A short message sent by readers to a journal's editor responding to previously published material, such as a letter to the editor, reply, or reader comment. |
| `libguides` | A library research guide (LibGuides) curated by librarians to point users toward resources on a topic or course. |
| `other` | A catch-all for works that fit no other type, such as news items, obituaries, full journal issues, and non-scholarly repository media (photographs, video, audio). |
| `paratext` | Records that package or frame a publication rather than carry its content, such as covers, title pages, tables of contents, and author guidelines. |
| `peer-review` | A peer review or report about a single other work, rather than a survey of many, such as an open peer review, referee report, or reviewer report. |
| `preprint` | An article whose primary location is a preprint repository such as arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SSRN, or Research Square. |
| `reference-entry` | A self-contained entry within a reference work, such as an encyclopedia article, dictionary entry, or handbook entry. |
| `report` | A technical report or working paper issued outside the journal system by an institution, agency, or company, such as a technical report, white paper, or government report. |
| `retraction` | A notice that formally withdraws an earlier work and explains why, with a reference to the work being retracted. |
| `review` | A journal article that summarizes and evaluates the existing research on a topic without reporting new findings, such as a literature review, systematic review, or meta-analysis. |
| `software` | A research software package or code released as a citable artifact, such as deposited code or a tagged software release with its own identifier, not a paper about it. |
| `software-paper` | A peer-reviewed paper written mainly to describe research software, such as a software article or descriptor, rather than to report research results. |
| `standard` | A formal standard or technical specification from a Standards Development Organization (SDO) or consortium, such as an ISO, IEEE, or W3C standard. |
| `supplementary-materials` | Supporting materials accompanying a primary work, usually a journal article, such as supporting-information files, supplementary figures, tables, or appendices. |

(The display name for each type is the same as its ID.)

Use these values with the `type` filter on works: `filter=type:article`

> **Note:**
> `book-review`, `conference-abstract`, `conference-paper`, `data-paper`, and `software-paper` are
> newly added to the vocabulary. They are being rolled out, so coverage is currently low or zero and
> they may not yet appear under [`works?group_by=type`](https://api.openalex.org/works?group_by=type).

## How types are assigned

Every work gets exactly one `type`. OpenAlex assigns it by mapping the type reported by the work's source — Crossref's `type`, DataCite's `resourceType`, PubMed's publication type, etc. — onto the OpenAlex vocabulary above, then applying a set of internal heuristics (for example, titles like "Index", "Cover Picture", or a bare journal name are classified as `paratext`). Approved [curations](/api/works/) can override the assigned type for an individual work.

## Paratext

`paratext` covers material that is part of a publication but not the scholarly content itself — front matter, back matter, indexes, covers, mastheads, and advertisements. Filter for it with `filter=type:paratext`.

> **Warning:**
> The separate boolean field **`is_paratext` is deprecated**. It is now derived directly from `type` (it is `true` exactly when `type` is `paratext`) and carries no additional information. Use `filter=type:paratext` instead of `filter=is_paratext:true`. `is_paratext` remains available for backward compatibility but may be removed in a future release.
