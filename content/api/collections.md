A **collection** is a private, named list of OpenAlex entities of one type — for
example, "Papers I'm tracking for this grant", "Authors at my consortium", or
"Journals I publish in". Collections give you a single ID you can drop into the
[`filter` parameter](/api/filtering/) anywhere in the API, instead of pasting
hundreds of OpenAlex IDs into every request.

> **Note:**
> Collections are private to the user who creates them. Manage them via
> authenticated requests against `user.openalex.org`, and use the `collection:`
> filter against `api.openalex.org` — both authenticated with your OpenAlex API
> key in the `Authorization: Bearer` header. You can only filter on collections
> you own.

## Concepts

| Property                         | Value                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| One entity type per collection   | `works`, `authors`, `sources`, `institutions`, `topics`, `sdgs`, `funders`, `publishers`, `keywords`, or `concepts` |
| Max entities per collection      | 1,000                                                     |
| Max collections per user         | 100                                                       |
| Display-name length              | 1–30 characters; case-insensitive unique per user         |
| Description length               | 0–500 characters                                          |
| ID shape                         | `col_` followed by 10 alphanumeric characters             |

A collection holds entities of a single type. To track works *and* the authors
of those works, create two collections.

## Creating a collection

The easiest way to create a collection is in the OpenAlex web UI at
[openalex.org](https://openalex.org):

1. Run a search.
2. Tick the rows you want to save (or use the master checkbox to select the
   whole page).
3. Click the folder icon in the results toolbar → **Create a new collection**.

You can also paste a list of IDs or DOIs straight into the create-collection
wizard at `https://openalex.org/settings/collections`.

To create one programmatically, `POST` to `/me/collections`:

```bash
POST https://user.openalex.org/me/collections
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "display_name": "My altmetrics papers",
  "entity_type": "works",
  "description": "Papers I'm tracking for the altmetrics review",
  "entity_ids": [
    "https://openalex.org/W2755968057",
    "https://openalex.org/W4404012345"
  ]
}
```

`entity_ids` is optional — you can create an empty collection and add entities
later. IDs may be supplied in full-URL form (`https://openalex.org/W123…`) or
short form (`W123…`); the API normalizes them. Every ID must match the
collection's `entity_type` — adding `A123…` to a `works` collection returns a
`400` naming the offending ID.

A successful create returns `201` with the saved collection:

```json
{
  "id": "col_beNWUTw6qY",
  "user_id": "user-TSamuHxDbnhn",
  "entity_type": "works",
  "display_name": "My altmetrics papers",
  "description": "Papers I'm tracking for the altmetrics review",
  "entity_count": 2,
  "created_at": "2026-05-26T14:00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-05-26T14:00:00"
}
```

## Filtering search results by collection

Once a collection exists, drop its ID into any search on the matching entity
type using the `collection:` filter:

```bash
# Every work in the col_beNWUTw6qY collection
GET https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=collection:col_beNWUTw6qY
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

This works on every entity type the collection system supports —
`/works`, `/authors`, `/sources`, `/institutions`, `/topics`, `/sdgs`,
`/funders`, `/publishers`, `/keywords`, `/concepts` — as long as the collection
and the endpoint match. Filtering an `authors` collection on `/works` returns
a `400`:

```
collection col_beNWUTw6qY is type 'authors', not valid for /works
```

The collection ID resolves to the underlying entity IDs at query time, so the
filter combines normally with other filters and with sorting, grouping,
selecting, and pagination:

```bash
# Open-access papers in this collection, newest first
GET https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=collection:col_beNWUTw6qY,is_oa:true&sort=publication_date:desc
```

### Negation

Prepend `!` to exclude the entities in the collection instead of including them:

```bash
GET https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=collection:!col_beNWUTw6qY
```

### Limits

- **One `collection:` filter per request.** Repeated or `|`-OR'd collection
  values return a `400`. To combine collections, snapshot the resolved IDs
  client-side and pass them via the `openalex:` filter.
- **Per-request entity-list ceiling: 10,000.** With the per-collection cap of
  1,000 entities, a single collection is always within budget.
- **Authentication required.** Pass your OpenAlex API key in the
  `Authorization: Bearer …` header. Anonymous requests return `401`;
  requests by a user who doesn't own the collection return `403`.

## Filtering by a collection on a related entity

The `collection:` filter above matches a collection against the endpoint of the
*same* type — a `sources` collection on `/sources`, an `authors` collection on
`/authors`. But collections are often most useful **across** types: filtering
one kind of entity by a collection of a *different* kind.

Any filter field whose value is an OpenAlex ID also accepts a `col_…`
collection of the matching type. OpenAlex resolves the collection to its member
IDs at query time and matches that field against them — so the collection ID
behaves exactly like a value for that field.

**Example — the library-subscription workflow.** A librarian builds a `sources`
collection of the ~1,000 journal IDs in their Elsevier (or Wiley, Springer, …)
package, then filters *works* by it through the `primary_location.source.id`
field:

```bash
# Every work published in a journal in your subscription collection
GET https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:col_beNWUTw6qY
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

Because the collection resolves to ordinary field values, it composes with every
other filter, plus sorting, grouping, selecting, and pagination. For example,
"open-access works from 2024 in my subscribed journals, grouped by author
institution":

```bash
GET https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:col_beNWUTw6qY,is_oa:true,publication_year:2024&group_by=authorships.institutions.id
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

The same pattern works for any ID-valued filter field, on any endpoint:

| Filter clause                                        | Collection type | Meaning                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:col_…`     | `sources`       | Works published in these journals/sources     |
| `/works?filter=authorships.author.id:col_…`          | `authors`       | Works by any of these authors                 |
| `/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:col_…`    | `institutions`  | Works affiliated with these institutions      |
| `/works?filter=primary_topic.id:col_…`               | `topics`        | Works on these topics                         |
| `/works?filter=funders.id:col_…`                     | `funders`       | Works funded by these funders                 |

This covers the ID-valued fields on `/works`, `/authors`, `/sources`, and
`/institutions` — including author and institution fields such as
`last_known_institutions.id` and `affiliations.institution.id`.

### Type matching

The collection's type must match the type the filter field expects. A `sources`
collection works on `primary_location.source.id` but not on
`authorships.author.id`; a mismatch returns a `400` naming both sides:

```
collection col_beNWUTw6qY is type 'sources', not valid for the `authorships.author.id` filter (expects 'authors').
```

A field that doesn't take an entity ID (for example a date or boolean field)
can't take a collection at all:

```
The `publication_year` filter does not support cross-type collection references (col_...). Use a same-type `collection:` filter or a literal value list.
```

### Negation

Prepend `!` to the collection ID to exclude its members, just like any other
filter value:

```bash
# Works NOT published in your subscribed journals
GET https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:!col_beNWUTw6qY
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

### Limits

- **One collection per filter field.** You can't OR two collections onto the
  same field (`field:col_a|col_b`) or repeat the field with a second collection
  — either returns a `400`. Use one collection per field; different fields in
  the same request can each carry their own collection.
- **Don't mix a collection with literal IDs in one clause.**
  `primary_location.source.id:col_…|S12345` returns a `400`. Pass the collection
  alone, or pass literal IDs alone.
- The per-collection cap of 1,000 entities still applies, and a single request
  resolves to at most 10,000 entity IDs across all of its collection filters.

## Managing collections

All endpoints below live on `user.openalex.org` and require your OpenAlex API key in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
Anonymous requests return `401`; requests for a collection owned by another
user return `403` (admins bypass this).

### List your collections

```bash
GET https://user.openalex.org/me/collections
```

Supports `?page=` and `?per_page=` (max 100). Pass `?entity_id=W2755968057` to
filter to collections that contain a specific entity — used by the
collection-chip strip on entity pages in the OpenAlex UI.

Response:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "page": 1, "per_page": 25, "total_count": 3, "total_pages": 1
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "col_beNWUTw6qY",
      "user_id": "user-TSamuHxDbnhn",
      "entity_type": "works",
      "display_name": "My altmetrics papers",
      "description": "Papers I'm tracking for the altmetrics review",
      "entity_count": 4,
      "created_at": "2026-05-20T16:00:00",
      "updated_at": "2026-05-26T14:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get a single collection

```bash
GET https://user.openalex.org/collections/{collection_id}
```

Returns the same shape as one row in `results` above. The collection's
entities are paged separately to keep response sizes bounded:

```bash
GET https://user.openalex.org/collections/{collection_id}/entities?per_page=200
```

Returns the collection metadata plus the page of `entity_ids` (max
`per_page=200`).

### Update name, description, or entity type

```bash
PATCH https://user.openalex.org/me/collections/{collection_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{ "display_name": "Renamed", "description": "Updated notes" }
```

`entity_type` can be changed only while the collection is empty.

### Delete a collection

```bash
DELETE https://user.openalex.org/me/collections/{collection_id}
```

Returns `{"deleted_collection_id": "col_…"}`. All `collection_entities` rows
cascade-delete.

### Add or remove entities

```bash
# Bulk add
POST https://user.openalex.org/me/collections/{collection_id}/entities
Content-Type: application/json

{ "entity_ids": ["W123…", "W456…"] }
```

Returns `{ "added": N, "already_present": M, "rejected_wrong_type": 0 }`.
Wrong-type IDs (e.g. an `A…` in a `works` collection) fast-fail with `400`
naming the first offender, so `rejected_wrong_type` is always `0` on
success — it's preserved in the response shape for backward compatibility.

```bash
# Bulk remove
DELETE https://user.openalex.org/me/collections/{collection_id}/entities
Content-Type: application/json

{ "entity_ids": ["W123…"] }
```

```bash
# Single remove via URL
DELETE https://user.openalex.org/me/collections/{collection_id}/entities/W123…
```

## Admin endpoints

OpenAlex admins can list, read, edit, or delete any user's collection:

| Method   | Path                                                | Notes                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | `/admin/collections?q=&owner_id=&entity_type=`      | Cross-user search, paged       |
| `GET`    | `/admin/collections/{collection_id}`                | Read any collection            |
| `PATCH`  | `/admin/collections/{collection_id}`                | Same body as the user PATCH    |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/collections/{collection_id}`                | Hard-delete with cascade       |

Non-admin callers get `403`.

## Validation rules

Collections are validated before they hit the database. The most common 400s:

| Code                       | Cause                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_type_invalid`      | `entity_type` missing or not one of the 10 supported types              |
| `display_name_invalid`     | Empty after trim, contains control characters, URL-shaped, or profane   |
| `display_name_too_long`    | More than 30 characters                                                 |
| `display_name_duplicate`   | You already have a collection with this name (case-insensitive)         |
| `description_invalid`      | Not a string, or contains control characters, or URL-shaped             |
| `entity_id_invalid`        | An ID doesn't look like any OpenAlex ID shape                           |
| `entity_id_wrong_type`     | An ID's type doesn't match the collection's `entity_type`               |
| `collection_full`          | Adding entities would exceed the 1,000-entity cap                       |
| `too_many_collections`     | You already own 100 collections                                         |
