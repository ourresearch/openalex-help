The `search` parameter finds results matching a given text search. Search requests cost **\$1 per 1,000 calls** (vs. \$0.10 per 1,000 for list+filter requests). See [pricing](/api/authentication/#pricing-by-endpoint).

```bash
# Works with "dna" in title, abstract, or fulltext
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=dna
```

## What gets searched

Each entity type searches different fields:

| Entity | Searchable fields |
|--------|-------------------|
| Works | `title`, `abstract`, `fulltext` |
| Authors | `display_name`, `display_name_alternatives` |
| Sources | `display_name`, `alternate_titles`, `abbreviated_title` |
| Institutions | `display_name`, `display_name_alternatives`, `display_name_acronyms` |
| Topics/Keywords | `display_name`, `description` |

## Text processing

OpenAlex uses [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and removes [stop words](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stop-tokenfilter.html) to improve results:

- Words like "the" and "an" are removed
- A search for "possums" also returns "possum"
- Searches match whole words only ("lun" won't match "lunar")

### Exact (unstemmed) search

Use `search.exact` to search without stemming:

```bash
https://api.openalex.org/works?search.exact=surgery
```

> **Note:**
> Only one search parameter is allowed per request: `search`, `search.exact`, or `search.semantic`.

## Boolean search

Use `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` (uppercase) for complex queries. Surround phrases with double quotes for exact matching:

```bash
# Works about "elmo" AND "sesame street" but NOT "cookie" or "monster"
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=(elmo AND "sesame street") NOT (cookie OR monster)
```

> **Note:**
> Words not separated by boolean operators are treated as `AND`.

## Large Boolean queries

Because the query travels in the request URL, the whole request URL is limited to about **4 KB** (roughly 4,000 characters). A very long `search=` value — typically a Boolean query with many `OR` terms, common in systematic reviews — can exceed this and return a `400` error:

```json
{
  "error": "Request URL too long",
  "message": "Your request URL is 4612 bytes, over the 4094-byte limit (roughly 4 KB, mostly the 'search' value). Split a large Boolean query into smaller chunks, request each separately, and combine the returned IDs client-side."
}
```

This is a fixed limit, not a usage/credit cost — splitting the query does not lose any results. To run a query larger than ~4 KB, split the `OR` list into chunks, request each chunk separately, and take the union of the returned IDs client-side. The result is exactly the same set of works:

```text
# Instead of one query that is too long:
search=(termA OR termB OR ... OR termZ) AND climate

# Split the OR list and union the IDs from each request:
search=(termA OR ... OR termM) AND climate
search=(termN OR ... OR termZ) AND climate
```

Keep each chunk's full request URL under ~4 KB. Combining results is exact because `(X AND (a OR b OR c OR d))` equals `(X AND (a OR b)) ∪ (X AND (c OR d))`. Putting `api_key` and `mailto` in request headers instead of the URL frees a little extra room, but for a large Boolean query you will still need to split it.

> **Tip:**
> Each chunked request is billed independently, just like any other request. Splitting is only needed to stay under the URL length limit — it is not a way to reduce cost.

## Phrase and proximity search

### Phrase matching

Use double quotes to search for an exact phrase. Multi-word searches without quotes rank results higher when words appear close together.

```bash Exact phrase (few results)
https://api.openalex.org/works?search="fierce creatures"
```

```bash Words anywhere (more results)
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=fierce creatures
```

### Proximity search

Append `~N` to a quoted phrase to find the words within N positions of each other, without requiring an exact match:

```bash
# "climate" and "change" within 5 words of each other
https://api.openalex.org/works?search="climate change"~5
```

This works for phrases of any length, not just two words. `N` is the total number of position moves allowed to line up all the terms — a single budget shared across the whole phrase, letting the words be reordered or spread apart as long as the total displacement stays within `N`. Widening `N` returns more matches:

```bash
# the three words near each other, in any order
https://api.openalex.org/works?search="climate change policy"~10
```

To require two **separate** phrases near each other — rather than loosening one phrase — join two quoted operands with `~N`. Each operand keeps its own words adjacent, and the two operands must appear within `N` words of each other, in either order:

```bash
# "machine learning" and "neural network" within 5 words of each other,
# each phrase kept intact
https://api.openalex.org/works?search="machine learning"~5~"neural network"
```

## Wildcards and fuzzy search

### Wildcards

Use `*` to match zero or more characters and `?` to match exactly one character:

- **Trailing wildcard:** `machin*` matches "machine", "machines", "machinery"
- **Single-character wildcard:** `wom?n` matches "woman" and "women"

The search term must have at least 3 characters before the wildcard. Leading wildcards (e.g., `*ology`) are not supported.

Wildcards require the **exact (unstemmed)** search — use `search.exact` (or the `default.search.exact` filter), not the default `search`. The default `search` is stemmed, which strips the literal text before the wildcard at index time, so a wildcard there would return wrong results; OpenAlex rejects it with a `400` rather than return misleading matches.

```bash
https://api.openalex.org/works?search.exact=machin*
```

Quotes around a **single** word make no difference: `search.exact="machin*"` behaves exactly like `search.exact=machin*` (a one-word "phrase" is just the word). Wildcards also work inside a multi-word quoted phrase, where they match as an adjacent phrase — see [Phrase matching](#phrase-matching) (e.g. `search.exact="smart* phone"`).

> **Tip:**
> To combine stemmed and truncated terms in one query — common in systematic-review search strategies — use the filter form so each term keeps its own matching: a stemmed `fulltext.search` filter alongside a wildcard `fulltext.search.exact` filter, e.g. `?filter=fulltext.search:treatment,fulltext.search.exact:psoriat*`.

### Fuzzy search

Append `~N` to a term to allow up to N character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions). The edit distance N can be 0, 1, or 2:

```bash
# Matches "machine", "machin", and other close variants
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=machin~1
```

The search term must have at least 3 characters before the `~`. This is useful for catching typos and spelling variations.

## Relevance score

Search results include a `relevance_score` property and are sorted by it (descending) by default. The score is based on:

- Text similarity to your search term
- Citation count (more cited = higher score)

## Semantic search

If you want to match by **meaning rather than keywords** — or if you're searching with a long input like an abstract or grant description — semantic search is a better fit. It uses AI embeddings to find conceptually related works even when the wording differs.

```bash
https://api.openalex.org/works?search.semantic=machine learning in healthcare
```

See the [Semantic Search guide](/api/semantic-search/) for examples, supported filters, and limits.

## Legacy: filter-based search

> **Warning:**
> **Deprecated.** The `filter=field.search:` syntax still works but is no longer recommended. Use the `search` query parameter instead.

The `.search` filter suffix searches a specific field rather than all searchable fields at once:

```bash
# Authors with "Einstein" in their name (deprecated)
https://api.openalex.org/authors?filter=display_name.search:einstein

# Works with "cubist" in the title only (deprecated)
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=title.search:cubist
```

The `fulltext.search` filter searches a work's title, abstract, and full text together — the same fields as the `search` query parameter. (The older `default.search` filter is a deprecated alias of `fulltext.search`: it still works and behaves identically, but `fulltext.search` is preferred.) Variants like `.search.exact` (unstemmed) and `.search.no_stem` also exist for some fields.

These filter-based searches cost the same $1 per 1,000 requests. For autocomplete use cases, use the [autocomplete endpoint](/api/autocomplete/) instead.

## Searching author bylines with `raw_author_name.search`

`raw_author_name.search` finds works where someone appears by a specific name-as-published — exactly the string in the byline of the paper. It's the one filter-based search that does *not* have a `search` parameter equivalent, so it stays the right tool for matching a person to their works.

> **Warning:**
> **It matches across all author names on the work, not within a single byline.** Each unquoted token can match a different author. A search for `raw_author_name.search:john smith` returns a work whose authors are `John Doe` and `Alice Smith` — neither person is named "John Smith," but the tokens appear somewhere in the byline list.

To scope a search to a single person (one byline), wrap the name in double quotes — the query becomes a phrase match against one `raw_author_name` at a time:

```bash
# Work-scoped: "john" and "smith" appear in *any* bylines (93,304 hits)
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:john smith

# Byline-scoped: works with an author named "John Smith" (2,727 hits)
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:"john smith"
```

### Allow middle names and initials with proximity (`~N`)

Append `~N` to a quoted name to allow up to N intervening tokens. This catches middle names and middle initials without dropping the byline scope:

```bash
# "Jane Smith" only — 1,661 hits
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:"jane smith"

# Also matches "Jane M Smith" — 3,779 hits
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:"jane smith"~1

# Also matches "Jane Marie Smith" — 4,571 hits
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:"jane smith"~2
```

Wider slop also picks up co-author noise on common names — start narrow and widen only when you need more recall.

### Handle name variants with `OR`

The filter value supports Lucene `OR` between quoted phrases. Use one OR'd query (not multiple `raw_author_name.search:` clauses — those `AND` together and return nothing) to combine name forms:

```bash
# Comma-reversed byline ("Priem, Jason" → "Priem Jason")
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:"jason priem" OR "priem jason"

# First-initial form
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:"j priem" OR "priem j"
```
