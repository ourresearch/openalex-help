OpenAlex's author entity resolution is good but imperfect. A profile (`A1234...`) can be missing real works (the byline used a name variant the resolver didn't link), and can also include works that belong to someone else (a different person with a similar byline got attached). This recipe finds both kinds of candidate so you can correct the profile. (Under 1¢ per profile)

> **Tip:**
> This is a good task to hand to an LLM agent. The "find missing works" half powers the "Add works" dialog on author profiles in the OpenAlex web UI.

The technique uses [`raw_author_name.search`](/api/searching/#searching-author-bylines-with-raw_author_namesearch), which matches the byline string on each work directly (rather than the resolved `author.id`). That lets you find works the resolver missed, and inspect the byline on each work currently attached to the profile.

## Step 1: Get the profile's display name

Fetch the author and pull `display_name`. That string is your query seed.

```bash
https://api.openalex.org/authors/A5023888391?select=id,display_name,display_name_alternatives,works_count
```

```json
{
  "id": "https://openalex.org/A5023888391",
  "display_name": "Jason R Priem",
  "display_name_alternatives": ["Jason Priem", "Jason, Priem", "Priem, Jason", "..."],
  "works_count": 67
}
```

`display_name_alternatives` can also be used as extra seeds, but vet them first — the field is collected from upstream byline metadata and sometimes includes unrelated names (cross-author confusion the resolver hasn't sorted out yet). Surname + given-token compatibility with the primary `display_name` is a reasonable filter.

## Step 2: Generate byline variants

Normalize the seed (lowercase, strip diacritics, drop punctuation, split on whitespace) into tokens, then generate quoted phrase variants:

| Variant | Example for `Jason Priem` | When to add |
|---|---|---|
| Typed | `"jason priem"` | Always |
| Comma-reversed | `"priem jason"` | ≥2 tokens |
| First-initial | `"j priem"`, `"priem j"` | First token >1 char |
| Slop `~1` on all of the above | — | If recall is still too low |
| Slop `~2` on all of the above | — | If recall is still too low |

For an author with middle tokens (e.g. `Jane M Smith`), also drop the middle tokens to generate `"jane smith"` / `"smith jane"` — otherwise the slop=0 form misses the no-middle-initial papers entirely.

## Step 3: Find candidate additions (missing works)

Fire the variants as one OR'd `raw_author_name.search` value. Combine OR'd phrases with `OR`, not multiple filter clauses (those `AND` together).

The OpenAlex web UI uses a 5-step "ladder" — start narrow, widen one step at a time, and stop as soon as `meta.count` clears a threshold (the dialog uses 100). Each rung trades precision for recall, so don't widen further than you need to.

```bash
# Step 1 — typed form only (narrowest). For seed "Jason R Priem":
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:"jason r priem",type:!paratext&corpus=all
# meta.count: 0    ← no byline uses the middle initial, so this finds nothing

# Step 2 — comma-reversed + drop-middles forms
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=raw_author_name.search:"jason r priem" OR "priem jason r" OR "jason priem" OR "priem jason",type:!paratext&corpus=all
# meta.count: 110  ← stops here (≥100)

# Step 3 — would add the first-initial form (only fires if step 2 still under threshold)
# "jason r priem" OR "priem jason r" OR "jason priem" OR "priem jason" OR "j priem" OR "priem j"
```

Two non-obvious query params worth knowing:

- **`corpus=all`** — without this, the API silently drops [expansion](/data/works/corpus/) works, about 22% of byline-match candidates.
- **`type:!paratext`** — excludes issue covers, errata, and similar where bylines are conflated.

Once you have the results, drop the works already on the profile (where some authorship's `author.id` is the target). Doing this client-side rather than via an `authorships.author.id:!A1234` filter clause lets you surface *duplicate* attributions too — the same paper attached to a different `J. Priem` entity, which a curator usually wants to see.

Then apply a byline-match gate: a work qualifies as an addition candidate only if at least one of its authorships' `raw_author_name` matches the seed on **surname AND (full first-given OR first-initial)**. Wider ladder steps (`"j priem"`) match works whose byline reads "Richard J. Priem" — a different person sharing surname + first initial; the gate is what filters those out.

```python
import unicodedata, re

def name_tokens(name):
    """Normalize a byline into tokens. Always treats 'Last, First' as the
    convention — non-standard comma formats will fail to match, which is
    deliberate (the alternative is heuristic guessing that masks real bugs)."""
    s = unicodedata.normalize("NFD", name or "")
    s = "".join(c for c in s if unicodedata.category(c) != "Mn")
    s = re.sub(r"[^a-z, ]", "", s.lower())
    if "," in s:
        last, _, rest = s.partition(",")
        s = f"{rest.strip()} {last.strip()}"
    return [t for t in s.split() if t]

def given_match(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return True
    return (len(a) == 1 and b.startswith(a)) or (len(b) == 1 and a.startswith(b))

def byline_matches_seed(raw_name, seed_tokens):
    cand = name_tokens(raw_name)
    if not cand or cand[-1] != seed_tokens[-1]:
        return False
    return len(seed_tokens) == 1 or given_match(seed_tokens[0], cand[0])

def matched_authorship(work, seed_tokens):
    """Return the authorship on `work` matching the seed on surname + given-compat, else None."""
    for a in work.get("authorships", []):
        if byline_matches_seed(a.get("raw_author_name") or "", seed_tokens):
            return a
    return None
```

## Step 4: Find candidate removals (wrongly-attributed works)

Fetch the works currently attached to the profile and run each one's *target authorship* through the same gate. Misses are candidates for removal — the resolver attributed the paper to this profile but the byline doesn't fit the seed.

```bash
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=author.id:A5023888391,type:!paratext&corpus=all&select=id,display_name,publication_year,cited_by_count,authorships,primary_topic&per_page=200
```

For each returned work, pull the authorship whose `author.id` equals the target. If its `raw_author_name` doesn't pass the surname + given-compat check, flag the work:

```python
def target_authorship(work, author_short_id):
    target = author_short_id.upper()
    for a in work.get("authorships", []):
        aid = (a.get("author", {}).get("id") or "").rsplit("/", 1)[-1].upper()
        if aid == target:
            return a
    return None

def is_removal_candidate(work, author_short_id, seed_tokens):
    a = target_authorship(work, author_short_id)
    return a is not None and not byline_matches_seed(
        a.get("raw_author_name") or "", seed_tokens
    )
```

> **Warning:**
> **False-positive classes worth knowing before you remove anything:** married/maiden-name changes, transliteration variants of non-Latin names (e.g. Chinese pinyin vs Wade-Giles), single-name authors, authors who publish under a pseudonym, and the occasional non-standard byline format (a byline written as `"First, Last"` with a stray comma flips wrong under the `Last, First` convention). A surname mismatch is a *signal*, not a verdict — always corroborate via ORCID, co-authors, or institution before removing.

## Scoring candidates: what's actually informative

The gate above keeps recall high in both directions; ranking the survivors by confidence is where the recipe earns its keep. The same signals apply to addition candidates (where the seed should match) and removal candidates (where it shouldn't). A few perform very differently than they look — the notes below come from an internal 1,400-author gold-standard evaluation of OpenAlex's resolver:

- **`authorships[].author.orcid` matching the target's ORCID is essentially ground truth** — but only ~30% of works in recent years carry a `raw_orcid` from the publisher, so this gates fewer candidates than expected. When present, take it.
- **Name rarity dominates everything else.** The same surname-plus-given-initial match means very different things for "J. Smith" and for a rare name. If you have access to a name-frequency estimate, weight by it — a rare-name candidate with no other signals is far more likely to be correct than a common-name candidate with two weak signals.
- **First-initial-only matches are noisier than they look.** In our overmerge analysis, ~17% of false-merges were "D. Sutcliffe" wrongly attributed to "David L. Sutcliffe" (or similar) — different people who share surname + first initial. Treat initial-only candidates as the weakest tier; require corroboration.
- **3+ shared co-authors within the same name block is a high-confidence merge signal** even without ORCID. Pairwise co-author overlap (1–2 shared) is much weaker.
- **CJK names are harder.** Expect a higher false-positive rate on East Asian names — same-script collisions are common, and the byline-match gate above is a romanization match, which loses information. Lean harder on ORCID / institution / co-author signals for these.
- **Most legitimately-missing works live on tiny "splinter" entities** (1–2 works each), not on other large profiles. Candidates currently attributed to an `author.id` with very few works are usually safe merges; candidates currently attributed to a large *other* profile deserve scrutiny.
