# Open houses

We have twice-weekly open houses on Zoom: every Wednesday at 12pm Eastern and every Thursday at 9am Eastern. These are 1-hour informal drop-in/drop-off sessions to have conversations about using OpenAlex. Some of these are themed based on OpenAlex developments and emerging topics; discussion on those topics will be given precedence.

## Upcoming schedule

Register for each day by clicking on the Zoom registration link. When you register, you will get a confirmation email with instructions on how to join.
